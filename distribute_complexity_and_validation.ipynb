The estimator interface is at the core of the library. It de\ufb01nes instantiation mechanisms of objects and exposes a `fit` method for learning a model from training data. All supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., for classi\ufb01cation, regression or clustering) are o\ufb00ered as objects implementing this interface. Machine learning tasks like feature extraction, feature selection or dimensionality reduction are also provided as estimators.\n",

It takes as input some new data X and yields as output a transformed version of X. Preprocessing, feature selection, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction algorithms are all provided as transformers within the library.\n",
